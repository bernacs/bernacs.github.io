Cyclone _Xaver_ also known as the North Sea flood or tidal surge of 2013, was a winter storm that affected northern Europe. Force 12 winds and heavy snowfall lead to storm surge causing coastal flooding along the coasts of the North and Irish Seas. The impact of the storm on the Baltic Sea was significantly weaker. However, many coasts and ports were completely destroyed. In Sztutowo (Poland) a big concrete slab was washed up on a beach. A thick layer of a polystyryne foam enabled it to float.
