*Rot in building construction* is an installation based on an error in urban planning. The architectural mistake resulted in the creation of a useless, triangular area 'in between' where two buildings were supposed join. My work is an attempt to reconstruct this space. The looped audio piece, based on conversations with builders, and a print on the floor construct a fragmentary narrative in an attempt to formulate a theory of the place.
